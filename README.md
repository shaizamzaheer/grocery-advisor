Hi everyone.

WHAT IS THE POINT OF GITHUB?

Different people can change code at once, and work on different features at the
same time. We can revert to previous versions of the code and we can see who's
working on something so we don't waste time with coordinating stuff.

Basically all of the files of the website are stored on GitHub. You download
the changes that people have made recently to your own computer. To do that just
click on clone. Then you edit the code using eclipse or any other IDE on your
own machine. After coding something, you save it on your computer, and GitHub
Desktop will show you all the changes you made. Select the files that you
edited and mention whatever you changed in the text box. Once you click on
commit on GitHub Desktop, your new files will be sent back to GitHub and
updated for everyone else.

All the commits people make will be done by default on the master branch.
Usually if you want to work on features that are more disruptive or kind of
in an alpha stage, you would create a new branch for that feature. That makes
it so that the master branch stays untouched, and people can continue with that.

Writing out what you did and why makes it easier and helps out a lot.
People often undervalue documentation.

HOW ARE WE WORKING TOGETHER?

This based on a workflow I've used in the past.
If you look at issues, you can see a list of stuff that needs to be done.
I didn't populate it properly yet, so if you want to work on an issue you can
add it and assign it to yourself and start working on it. This is usually so
people don't end up working on the same thing at once.

Feel free to elaborate if people want to add something.
