Hi everyone.

WHAT IS THE POINT OF GITHUB?

Different people can change code at once, and work on different features at the
same time. We can revert to previous versions of the code and we can see who's
working on something so we don't waste time with coordinating stuff.

Basically all of the files of the website are stored on GitHub. To get them on
your own computer just click on clone. That will download the files to your 
computer for the first time. Every time after that when you want to update your 
own files from Github after someone has made changes, you click on fetch origin 
in the Desktop Client. Then you edit the code using eclipse or any other IDE on your
own machine. After coding something, you save it on your computer, and GitHub
Desktop will show you all the changes you made. Select the files that you
edited and mention whatever you changed in the text box. Once you click on
commit and then push to origin on GitHub Desktop, your new files will be 
sent back to GitHub and updated for everyone else.

All the commits people make will be done by default on the master branch.
Usually if you want to work on features that are more disruptive or kind of
in an alpha stage, you would create a new branch for that feature. That makes
it so that the master branch stays untouched, and people can continue with that.

Writing out what you did and why makes it easier and helps out a lot.
People often undervalue documentation.

HOW ARE WE WORKING TOGETHER?

This based on a workflow I've used in the past.
If you look at the issues tab on top, you can see a list of stuff that needs
to be done. I didn't populate it properly yet, so if you want to work on an 
issue you can add it and assign it to yourself and start working on it. This 
is usually so people don't end up working on the same thing at once.

Feel free to elaborate if people want to add something to this file.
You can also edit right on GitHub for something like a readme.
